# Unity-Test-Project
Native mobile integration with Unity both for iOS and Android:


## Install steps:

* Open the project in Unity.  
* Select the StartScene as the root scene  
* Check if project runs correctly. Note that it's not interactable in Unity editor.
* Exporting to Andorid:  
  File > Build Settings...  
  Check `Export project` checkbox when exporting to Android and select the root folder as `/build/android`  
  Open the project in Android studio and build it.    
* Exporting to iOS:  
  File > Build Settings...  
  Select the root folder as `/build/ios` and name it `app`  
  When prompted, select 'append'  
  Open the xcodeproj and build to device  


## Things to note and further improve:

* The Android manifest gets overwritten each time a Unity export is initiated. According to the docs, the manifest is placed inside `Assets/Plugins/Android/`. When a new change is made to the manifest, the same must be copied back to `Assets/Plugins/Android/`. I should add a graddle preBuild script to copy that automatically.  

* Current commit contains irrelevant autogenerated code. I should further optimise gitignore-s  
  
* I should play around with interface orientations as the UnityPlayer is also listening for orientation changes...  

* Communication from iOS to Unity is currently through comma-separated string... JSON serialization is to be added if needed
